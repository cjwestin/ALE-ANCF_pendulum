# ALE-ANCF_pendulum

Simulation of a flexible cable pendulum using the ALE-ANCF finite element 
method. The simulation uses a novel semi-implicit integration method based 
on the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor-alpha method.

Full details of the model can be found in 'Efficient semi-implicit 
numerical integration of ANCF and ALE-ANCF cable models with holonomic 
constraints' by C. Westin and R.A. Irani, Computational Mechanics, 2023.

Instructions:
Run pendulum_driver.m to simulate the system. Note that it will clear the 
workspace.
Run pendulum_animate.m to animate the results.
